# Latitudes-Longitudes

A city’s location is represented with its longitude and latitude.
Longitudes are imaginary semi-circles that intersect equator line with 90°
starting from one pole to the other (North Pole and South Pole). Greenwich
(in London) is accepted as a reference point (0°) for longitudes. There are
180 longitudes on the eastern side of this reference point (0° to +180°)
and 180 longitudes on the western side (0° to -180°).
Latitudes are also imaginary circles which stand parallel to the equator
starting from equator to both North and South Pole. It is known that there
are 180 latitudes on earth and equator is accepted as a reference (0°) for
them. There are 90 latitudes within the northern part of the equator (0°
to 90°). Southern part of the equator includes the rest of the latitudes (0°
to -90°). In the table below, some cities are shown and you may get the
idea of how a city’s location is represented.
